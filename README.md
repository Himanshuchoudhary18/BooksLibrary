# BooksLibrary
Here, user can store their favorite books 


#STEPS:
1) We start with bootstrap which is used here for the whole logic and design of the webpage
2) Then by the help of bootstrap and css it is given some basic styling (which makes easier for user to add books with it's author name
3) Then i provided search option for users, because it might be possible that in "lists of book" it is hard to find the required one, so search() will help
4) Once the book is added there is a message that will pop up at the top of the screen
5) If the book is not added in the list then error messsage will be generated
